# Rappid.js
Project built using LAMP stack, and PHP for backend.  Using jQuery and Rappid.js for front end.

## Tasks

1. Instead of loading that emergency procedure as the initial chart, have it load the JSON from the server over ajax. 
2. Add a button to the top toolbar to save the existing chart as JSON, also over ajax, to a PHP endpoint. You can write to a flat file for now.

2. git clone https://github.com/matt-catellier/rappidUI.git 
3. cd KitchecnSink 3 
4. npm install
4. go to local host with patch /KitchenSink/public

NOTE:
* make sure you have read, write, execute permissions on the folder you store it in
